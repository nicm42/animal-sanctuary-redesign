The site should:

- only use the current colours and fonts
- only use the current homepage content
- include lots of pictures of animals
- be AA accessible
- not be so flashy people think they have plenty of money
- direct people to give money/volunteer/adopt an animal
- be clear that they have dogs, cats and rabbits only

- [Holly Hedge](https://hollyhedge.org.uk/)
  - The donate button is not very visible
  - The carousel of dog and cat pictures is not that useful
  - I like the coloured boxes around each piece of content, but the grey text is very hard to read on some of them
  - Overall there's just too much colour
- [Farplace Animal Rescue](https://www.farplace.org.uk/)
  - This looks really clean with not too many colours and all the boxes the same size
  - The donate and adopt buttons really stand out - less so the volunteer one
  - I like the overlay behind the text on the hero, although it would be better if the only cat in the hero image was on the right so the other isn't half-obscured by the text
- [Battersea Cats and Dogs Home](https://www.battersea.org.uk/)
  - This looks really clean, as you'd expect from such a big animal sanctuary
  - I'm not a fan of the carousel - I think they should all be visible
  - I like their separate sections with cards all the same size
  - The donate button is very clear
- [Hillside Animal Sanctuary](https://www.hillside.org.uk/)
  - Looks like it's straight out of the 90s (it's all done with tables, so probably is a very old site)
  - Way too busy and way too tiny
- [Dean Farm Trust](https://deanfarmtrust.org.uk/animal-sanctuary/)
  - I love the horse in the hero header - pity he's not visible on mobile
  - Something weird is going on with the hero when I scroll. I think it might be a weird parallax
  - Even though there's not always a lot on the page it somehow feels very busy
  - Donation links aren't very obvious unless you scroll almost to the bottom
- [The Farm Animal Sanctuary](https://www.thefarmanimalsanctuary.co.uk/)
  - I like the photo-based cards with zoom on hover
  - None of the icons show up
  - Donate link is very obvious
